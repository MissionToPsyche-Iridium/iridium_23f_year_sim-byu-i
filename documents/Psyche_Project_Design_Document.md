# Psyche Project Design Document

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Overview**: Briefly describe the purpose of the "Psyche" project. For example, this software will allow users to draw an asteroid based on hints, compare it with artist renditions, and learn fun facts about the asteroid.
- **Goals**: Provide an interactive educational tool about the asteroid Psyche, making science and space exploration more engaging.

## 2. Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Five hints about the appearance of the asteroid.
  - A drawable canvas where users can sketch the asteroid.
  - A blank, colorless outline of the asteroid as a guide.
  - A system to compare the user’s drawing with artist renditions.
  - Trivia and fun facts about the asteroid.
  - Age and weight calculators based on the asteroid’s characteristics.
- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - The application should be user-friendly and responsive.
  - It should support different screen sizes (mobile/tablet/desktop).
  - Must ensure accurate scientific calculations for age and weight.
  - Low latency in canvas rendering and drawing comparisons.

## 3. System Architecture
- **Frontend**: 
  - A web-based interface using technologies like HTML5 Canvas for drawing and interactive content.
  - Frameworks: React.js or Vue.js for dynamic UI.
- **Backend**: 
  - Server-side logic for comparing drawings and performing calculations.
  - Backend technologies (Node.js, Python/Django, or others).
- **APIs and Libraries**:
  - Drawing canvas library (e.g., Konva.js, Paper.js).
  - Scientific API or backend logic for age/weight calculations.

## 4. Data Models
- **Asteroid Data**: Store trivia, facts, artist renditions, and asteroid characteristics.
- **User Data**: Optional storage of user progress, drawings, or age/weight information (if login or saving is a feature).
- **Comparison Algorithm**: Outline the data structure used for comparing user drawings with the artist renditions.

## 5. Technical Design
- **Hint System**: Logic for providing five hints about the asteroid, progressively narrowing down what it looks like.
- **Canvas Drawing**: Detail how the canvas will be implemented, including the tools available to users (e.g., different brush sizes, erasers).
- **Comparison Engine**: Describe how the software will compare user drawings to pre-loaded artist renditions. Consider algorithms for image comparison, perhaps using pixel-by-pixel or feature recognition.
- **Calculators**: 
  - Age calculator based on time dilation or surface age assumptions of the asteroid.
  - Weight calculator using the asteroid's gravitational data.

## 6. User Interface (UI) Design
- **UI Mockups**: Include basic wireframes for:
  - The drawing canvas.
  - Hints and trivia display.
  - Comparison results page.
  - Age and weight calculator input and result screens.
- **User Interaction Flows**: How users will navigate between drawing, trivia, and calculators.

## 7. Development Plan
- **Timeline**:
  - **Phase 1**: Basic drawing functionality and hint system.
  - **Phase 2**: Implement the comparison engine.
  - **Phase 3**: Add trivia, fun facts, and calculators.
  - **Phase 4**: Stretch goal (hard mode) and additional features.
- **Tools**:
  - IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, WebStorm).
  - Version control (GitHub or GitLab).
  - Testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha for JS; PyTest for Python).

## 8. Testing Plan
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components, such as the canvas, hint logic, and calculators.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the flow between components (e.g., drawing to comparison, hint progression).
- **User Testing**: Get feedback from potential users on usability, performance, and educational value.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the application performs well on different devices and screen sizes.

## 9. Stretch Goals
- **Hard Mode**: Only provides one hint at a time, increasing the challenge for users.
- **Additional Content**: More trivia and in-depth educational material about the asteroid.
