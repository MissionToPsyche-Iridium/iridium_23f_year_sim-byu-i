## The Asteroid - Jackson Westover Oct 18, 2024
Psyche, sometimes referred to as Psyche 16 (given the fact it is the 16th asteroid ever to be discovered), orbits our sun between Mars and Jupiter. The "potato shaped" asteroid was first discovered by astronomer Annibale de Gasparis in 1852. Due to Psyche's orbit speed the distance between the asteroid and Earth can vary anywhere from 186 million miles to 372 million miles. Psyche is a very dense asteroid with 212 - 256 pounds per cubic foot, 30% - 60% of that is composed of metal, a significant amount of which is believed to be metal found from the core of a former planet. The gravity on Psyche 16 is very little when compared to Earth, NASA compares lifting a car on Psyche to lifting a large dog on Earth.
