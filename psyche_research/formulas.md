## AGE
1 year on Psyche is 1828 Earth days (~5 years)

### Formula using years
Psyche Age = Earth Age * 5

### Formula using days
Psyche Age = (Earth Age * 365.25) / 1828

## Gravity
Gravity on Psyche is 0.144 m/s^2

For quick reference: 
Earth Gravity: 9.8 m/s^2
Moon Gravity: 1.6 m/s^2

### Formula for weight
*this formula should be able to use kilograms or pounds since the ratio between Earth and Psyche gravity is the same*

Psyche Weight = Earth Weight * (0.144 / 9.8)
